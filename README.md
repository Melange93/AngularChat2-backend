# Basic Chat Backend

  This is the back-end part to Basic Chat: https://github.com/Melange93/AngularChat2-frontend/tree/chatroom
  I use Spring Boot for the chat and MySql as a database with JPA. 
  You can change the basic settings in application.properties.

## Database basic settings:
  Name: angularchat
  Port: 3306
  User: root
  Password: ''
